== Description ==

Noteblog is SEO optimized for the search engines Google and Bing, while being a modern and simple responsive WordPress theme. Journalists, writers and authors can use it to publish news through blogging or writing with our minimalistic multipurpose magazine / newspaper theme. We have made clean code so the load time is fast, quick page speed is a big part of our SEO friendly theme. Whether you like food, fashion, photography, travel or need a business portfolio then our minimal article theme is a good choice. If you are a corporate business or agency, you can use it to design your creative & elegant landing page. Bloggers can use ads like adsense and affiliate marketing for your blog page about books, actors or other entertainment as well as write a journal / biography about your personal life with our typography optimised, reading friendly, flat and light design. We don't yet fully support websites having a one page / single page with post builder plugins, but we will add that soon together with making special white and dark layouts for school, education, coach and conference sites. Noteblog has many features such as widgets, header image and responsive design so it works on mobile phones too.
